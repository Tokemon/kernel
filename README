This is the README for the Simux Operating System/Kernel

WHAT IS SIMUX ?

 It is a small Unix clone, written mostly from scratch.

HOW COMPLETE IS IT ?

 It is 10% complete. I want to add more parts, but my time is limited.

HOW CAN I BUILD IT ?

 You will need clang/llvm and make, on an unix-like operating system.
 Type "make" in the top directory.
